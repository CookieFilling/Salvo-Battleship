# Salvo-Battleship
An analysis of a targeting ships strategy for a variant of Battleship known as Salvo Battleship. The program simulates many games of Salvo Battleship using random targeting versus a modified strategy based on Nick Berry's PDF strategy for regular Battleship.
(Heatmaps for each turn of the game can be generated using the plotly.express module.)
